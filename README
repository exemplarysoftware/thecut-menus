The Cut Django App: Menus

============
thecut.menus
============

This application requires ``thecut.authorship``, ``thecut.ordering``, and
``thecut.publishing``.


To install this application (whilst in the project's activated virtualenv)::
    pip install git+ssh://git@git.thecut.net.au/thecut-menus


Add the ``thecut.menus`` to the project's ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'thecut.menus',
    )


===========
Development
===========

To set yourself up for development, check out the repository from git
and ``cd`` into the directory that was created::

    git clone git@git.thecut.net.au:thecut-menus


Create a ``virtualenv`` for the project and install the development
requirements::

    cd thecut-menus
    virtualenv .
    source bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the app's tests with ``./run.sh test``. This will run the tests
with the version of Django specified in requirements.txt (this should
be kept updated to whichever version we're currently developing
against.)

To run the tests against all the versions of Python and Django which
this app supports, run the ``tox`` command.
